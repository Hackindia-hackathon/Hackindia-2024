# Photo Secure WebApp IPFS Vault

This project implements a crypted IPFS vault using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack along with blockchain technology. The vault allows users to securely store files on the IPFS network while encrypting the data and managing access through blockchain-based and JWT authentication.

## Features

- **Encrypted File Storage:** Files are stored on IPFS in an encrypted format, ensuring data privacy.
- **Blockchain-Based Access Control:** Access to stored files is managed through smart contracts on the blockchain, providing decentralized and tamper-proof access control.
- **JWT Authentication:** Users authenticate using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure access to the vault.
- **MERN Stack:** Built using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js for a full-stack web application.
- **MetaMask Integration:** Users can authenticate and interact with the blockchain via MetaMask.
- **IPFS for Decentralized Storage:** Files are stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), providing a decentralized solution for file storage.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** Database for storing user data and file metadata.
- **Express.js:** Web framework for building the server-side application.
- **React.js:** Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for the backend.
- **IPFS:** Decentralized file storage system.
- **Blockchain:** Smart contracts for managing access control.
- **JWT:** JSON Web Tokens for user authentication.
- **MetaMask:** Ethereum wallet for blockchain transactions.
