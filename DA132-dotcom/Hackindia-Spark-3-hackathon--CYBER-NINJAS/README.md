CYBER NINJAS presents Emotion aware surveillance 
Guys, check this project is live and crazy. We're bringing the world of tech and security investigation like never ever before!
*Problem:*  
Traditional surveillance systems focus solely on visual monitoring without the ability to assess the emotional state of individuals. This limitation prevents security personnel from identifying potentially risky or distressing situations that may not be immediately evident from visual data alone. For instance, someone might exhibit signs of extreme anxiety or anger, which could be early indicators of a security threat or personal distress. Without emotion detection, these cues are often missed, leading to delayed or inadequate responses in critical situations.

*Challenge:*  
Current technologies for emotion detection are often resource-intensive, requiring complex setups and significant computational power. Additionally, these systems are rarely integrated with real-time surveillance, limiting their practical application in environments where quick responses are essential.

*Objective:*  
To develop an Emotion-Aware Surveillance System that enhances traditional surveillance by integrating real-time emotion detection. The system should be capable of detecting emotions from facial expressions, providing immediate audio feedback or alerts based on the detected emotions. This integration aims to improve the effectiveness of security measures, enhance customer experience in commercial settings, and offer new tools for monitoring mental health in various environments.
